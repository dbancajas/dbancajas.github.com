		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>Hi there! I am a third year PhD student at USU ECE Department.
		I am a member of the <a href="http://www.engr.usu.edu/bridge">USU BRIDGE Lab</a> working under the guidance of Prof. <a href="http://www.engr.usu.edu/ece/faculty/kchak/">Koushik Chakraborty</a>. Before coming to <a href="http://www.usu.edu">Utah State</a> in Fall of 2010, I obtained my BS and MS degrees at the University of the Philippines. <br />
<br />

My primary area of interest spans both Computer Architecture and VLSI design of reliable computing systems. As technology scales down, the reliability of transistors becomes a major factor in emerging computing systems. My research exploits architectural techniques to design reliable computers. In the past, I have also dabbled in the design of energy efficient three-dimensional multicores. Kindly check out my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page for more details.


		<h4 color="red">I am currently seeking full-time positions in Computer Architecture/VLSI. My expected completion date for my PhD May 2014.</h4>

accepted for publication in the <a href="http://www.dac.com">2014 Design
Automation Conference (DAC 2014)</a> on June 2014 at San Francisco. I have also
another accepted journal paper in Transactions for Very-Large Integration
System for my work on Wear-out Resilient NoCs. See <a
