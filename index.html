		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>Hi there! I am a third year PhD student at USU ECE Department.
		I am a member of the <a href="http://www.engr.usu.edu/bridge">USU BRIDGE Lab</a> working under the guidance of Prof. <a href="http://www.engr.usu.edu/ece/faculty/kchak/">Koushik Chakraborty</a>. Before coming to <a href="http://www.usu.edu">Utah State</a> in Fall of 2010, I obtained my BS and MS degrees at the University of the Philippines. <br />
<br />

My primary area of interest spans both Computer Architecture and VLSI design of reliable computing systems. As technology scales down, the reliability of transistors becomes a major factor in emerging computing systems. My research exploits architectural techniques to design reliable computers. In the past, I have also dabbled in the design of energy efficient three-dimensional multicores. Kindly check out my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page for more details.

		</p>

		<p class="highlight_red"> I am currently seeking full-time positions in Computer Architecture/VLSI. My expected completion date for my PhD this May 2014. </p>
